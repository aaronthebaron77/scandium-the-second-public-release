3] Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in the file `botsettings.json` with the token of your application.

4] [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Node.js.

5] Invite the bot to a discord server by filling in this template url:
   ```https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOT_ID_HERE&permissions=8&scope=bot*```

6] Open up command prompt in the root directory of the project folder and run the command `node bot.js`. This should bring the bot online.
